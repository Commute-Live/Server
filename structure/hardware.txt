Hardware selection notes

Goal: build a standalone, Wi-Fi enabled LED display to show transit data from our backend, without using a Raspberry Pi.

After testing different approaches (Raspberry Pi + HATs, ESP32 + adapters), we settled on an ESP32-based HUB75 controller to minimize complexity.

Chosen parts:

ESP32 Matrix Controller (MatrixPortal S3 compatible)
Used as both the microcontroller and HUB75 driver. Handles Wi-Fi, API calls, and rendering directly to the panel.

RGB LED Matrix Panel (P2.5, 64×32, HUB75)
Indoor full-color LED panel. Standard HUB75 interface supported by the controller.

5V Power Supply for LED Panel
LED panel requires high current and cannot be powered over USB. Dedicated 5V supply is used.

USB Power Supply for Controller
ESP32 controller is powered separately via USB.

Power setup:

LED panel powered directly by the 5V high-current supply

ESP32 controller powered via USB

Shared ground between controller and panel

This setup is sufficient to run the display, connect to Wi-Fi, fetch API data, and render it on the LED panel without additional hardware.
